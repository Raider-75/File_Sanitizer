Purpose: Organize and rename files.

Explained:  Idk I got bored with manually changing my files names for pictures and such. 
            So I implemented some code in Python in order to rename my files. 
            After that I thought I could make an .exe to help anyone else who wanted to do the same. 
            Also it would be easier to do that than run it through python every time. 
            Plus a UI is nice to organize it better.
